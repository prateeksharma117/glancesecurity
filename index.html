    <h1>Security Measures for Stranger Video Calls</h1>
    <p>At our company, we prioritize the safety and security of our users. That's why we have implemented the following measures to ensure a secure video call experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>End-to-end encryption: All video calls are encrypted from end-to-end, meaning that the video and audio data is protected while in transit and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.</li>
      <li>Screen sharing protection: Screen sharing is disabled by default, and can only be enabled by the user if they choose to do so. This prevents any unauthorized access to sensitive information.</li>
      <li>Password protection: All video calls are protected with a unique password, ensuring that only those with the password can join the call.</li>
      <li>Automatic disconnection: If a video call is disconnected, the session will automatically end, and the video and audio data will no longer be accessible.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to these measures, we also encourage all users to be cautious when participating in video calls with strangers, and to avoid sharing any personal or sensitive information during the call.</p>
